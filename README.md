# Use DLIViewer as default image view in Windows

  - 1 - Locate the DLIViewer.exe program on your computer. Make sure you know the exact file path (C:\Program Files\DLIViewer\DLIViewer.exe).
  
  - 2 - Right-click on an image file (e.g., JPEG, PNG) that you want to open with DLIViewer.exe.
  
  - 3 - From the context menu, select "Open with" and then click on "Choose another app."
  
  - 4 - A window will appear with a list of available apps. If DLIViewer.exe is listed, select it. If it's not listed, click on the option "More apps" at the bottom of the list.
  
  - 5 - In the "Choose an app" window, scroll down and click on the link "Look for another app on this PC."
  
  - 6 - Navigate to the file path where DLIViewer.exe is located. Select DLIViewer.exe and click "Open."
  
  - 7 - Windows will now open the selected image file with DLIViewer.exe. Additionally, DLIViewer.exe will be added to the list of available apps for opening image files by default.
  
  - 8 - Repeat steps 2-7 for other image file types if you want DLIViewer.exe to be the default viewer for those file types as well.

Now, whenever you double-click on an image file, Windows 10 will open it using DLIViewer.exe by default!
