Update 2.0!
- Complete abandonment of PyQt Fluent Widgets interface, now only standard widgets from PyQt5 are used.
- Viewing images is now done via QLabel instead of QGraphicsView.
- Removed almost all functionality of the app (temporarily).
- You can now view folder content through the Dock widget (you can hide it if you want).
- Replaced the standard method of checking a file (extension list) by checking its mimetype.
- Added the ability to open full screen mode.
